# Contribution Guidelines

Hello and thanks for your interest in contributing. With your help, we hope we can make a better alternative to meetup.com.

## About the project

This started out as a demo for [Keystone 5](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5/) and was expanded on to build the [SydJS Website](https://www.sydjs.com/).

It's not currently as fully featured as meetup, but it offers a good experience out of the box and is great for anyone who want to build and manage their own site. We welcome your contributions to make it even better.

Any features that make it easier for attendees and organisers are always welcome. Please create an issue first to discuss new functionality.

Features we're looking for right now include:

- Waitlists
- Live previews before publishing
- Better location options

## How to contribute

1. Fork this repository on Github
1. Clone your fork to your local device
1. Install dependencies with yarn: `yarn`
1. Create a new branch for the feature you are working on
1. Run `yarn dev` to build and watch for code changes

When creating a pull request please include a detailed description of the change along with screenshots where relevant. Remember to create issues so we can first discuss any significant change. We don't want to hold up PRs with discussion.

Not all contributions need to be code. Please raise issues and contribute to discussions.

Thanks for all your help!
